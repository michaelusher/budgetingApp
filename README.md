# Budgeting App
In my fall semester of 2022, I was taught how to create a mobile application with the use of Dart and Flutter in my class Mobile Application Development.

The application I was responsible in developing is a financial advisory application. 
In addition, the application was developed and submitted in various stages, hence the name "stage3.mov" or "mainStage3.dart" as an assignment requirement.
Lastly, you are able to get a quick demo of the application by downloading and watching, stage3.mov.
